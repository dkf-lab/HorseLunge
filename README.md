## About

Designed for a Fiverr client.

Minecraft horses are quite boring - my client wanted to fix this! This plugin adds user created illnesses, which are defined using config files, which can have vaccines and different percentage chances of getting caught, murdering horse, etc.

Also adds food/water requirements, which the player is notified on when they get low.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Compile plugin and place in your server's `plugins` folder.
